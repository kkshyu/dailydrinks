This project was built with styled-components and twitter-bootstrap

there are some special things in it:
* customized svg component for coloring
* fake uuid as mocked backend
* feature-based component file structure for high extendibility

I also found out a bug in styled-component and the native input element.
If you are interested in it, please find `NOTICE` in code.
